      The `<base>` tag below is present to support two advanced deployment options:
      1) Differential serving. 2) Serving from a non-root path.
      Instead of manually editing the `<base>` tag yourself, you should generally either:
      a) Add a `basePath` property to the build configuration in your `polymer.json`.
      b) Use the `--base-path` command-line option for `polymer build`.
      Note: If you intend to serve from a non-root path, see [polymer-root-path] below.
